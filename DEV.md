# Developer instructions

Below we describe how you can set up local environment and contribute to `solo`.

* Clone the repo
* In order to support ES6 modules with `jest`, set an env
  variable `export NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules >> ~/.zshrc`
  * If you are using Intellij and would like to use debugger tools, you will need to
    enable `--experimental-vm-modules` for `Jest`.
    * `Run->Edit Configurations->Edit Configuration Templates->Jest` and then set `--experimental-vm-modules`
      in `Node Options`.
* Run `npm i` to install the required packages
* Run `npm link` to install `solo` as the CLI
  * Note: you need to do it once. If `solo` already exists in your path, you will need to remove it first.
  * Alternative way would be to run `npm run solo -- <COMMAND> <ARGS>`
* Run `npm test` or `npm run test` to run the unit tests
* Run `solo` to access the CLI.
* Note that debug logs are stored at `$HOME/.solo/logs/solo.log`. So you may use `tail -f $HOME/.solo/logs/solo.log | jq
  ` in a separate terminal to keep an eye on the logs.
* Before making a commit run `npm run format`

## E2E tests

* In order to run E2E test, we need to set up cluster and install the chart.
  * Run `./test/e2e/setup-e2e.sh`
  * Run `npm run test-e2e`
