## Use the Task tool to launch Solo

For users who want to quickly deploy a standalone solo network without need to know what is under the hood,
they can use the Task tool to launch the network with a single command.

First, install the cluster tool `kind` with this [link](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start#installation)

Then, install the task tool `task` with this [link](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation)

Then, use the following steps to install dependencies and build solo project.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

### Start solo network

User can use one of the following three commands to quickly deploy a standalone solo network.

```bash
# Option 1) deploy solo network with two nodes

# Option 2) deploy solo network with two nodes, and mirror node
task default-with-mirror

# Option 3) deploy solo network with two nodes, mirror node, and JSON RPC relay
task default-with-relay
```
